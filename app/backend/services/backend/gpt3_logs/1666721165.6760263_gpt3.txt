RESPONSE:

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new guidance on how to use face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The advice is aimed at the general public and health workers and is based on evidence that the virus is primarily spread through droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The WHO says the use of face masks can help reduce the spread of the virus by delivering some protection to people who may have the disease but do not know it. It also recommends that people with symptoms wear a face mask to protect others. The WHO says you should always wash your hands before putting on a mask, as well as before and after taking it off. If you are wearing a mask, you should also avoid touching your face, nose or mouth. You should also discard your mask if it gets wet or dirty. The WHO says you should only wear a mask if you have symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing, or if you are caring for someone who may have the disease. If you are healthy and without symptoms, there is no need for you to wear a mask. The WHO says that medical masks, such as surgical masks and disposable masks, should be reserved for health workers. The organization says that cloth masks are suitable for the general public but must be regularly cleaned with soap and water. Cloth masks can be reused after being washed at least once a day in hot water. The WHO advises that cloth masks can be made at home using materials such as cotton fabrics, coffee filters and old t-shirts. The WHO advises that non-medical cloth masks should be worn by people over the age of 60, by children under the age of 5, by people with underlying health conditions and by people who are taking care of someone with suspected COVID-19 infection in their home. People who have symptoms of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask when they leave their home to seek medical care.
