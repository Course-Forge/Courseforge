RESPONSE:

The new season of The CW’s The Flash is coming to an end, but fans can still expect a few surprises along the way. The CW has released a new promo for the season finale, titled “We Are The Flash,” which gives a look at what’s to come and teases the return of some familiar faces. You can check out the promo in the video above. The promo teases that Team Flash will be facing their biggest challenge yet in the season finale as they go up against Clifford DeVoe/The Thinker (Neil Sandilands). It also gives a look at Barry’s (Grant Gustin) impending trial for saving Iris (Candice Patton) from being murdered last season and what that could mean for the future of The Flash and his friends. The promo also shows Iris, Joe (Jesse L. Martin), and Cisco (Carlos Valdes) coming face-to-face with Ralph Dibny/The Elongated Man (Hartley Sawyer) and his abilities for the first time, with Iris expressing her concern about Ralph’s ability to make people tell him secrets. The promo also reveals that Ralph will have to make a decision about whether or not to use his abilities to help Team Flash in their fight against The Thinker. The promo also teases that other familiar faces will be returning in the season finale, including Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker) and Killer Frost, as well as Killer Frost’s mother, Dr. Carla Tannhauser (Susan Walters). It’s unclear how Carla will factor into the season finale but it will be interesting to see how she interacts with Caitlin and Killer Frost now that she knows her daughter has developed superpowers. The Flash’s season finale airs Tuesday, May 22 at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.
