RESPONSE:

It started with a conversation. "What do you think?" I asked my husband. "Do you think it's possible that we could get a dog?" He looked at me, raised his eyebrows and smiled. "Are you serious?" he asked. "Yes," I said. "I've been thinking about it for a while." We talked about the pros and cons of having a dog, took our time and eventually decided that we would get one. We had a list of things that we wanted in a dog, one of which was that it had to be small enough for us to take whenever we traveled. We also wanted it to be hypoallergenic, as my daughter is allergic to dogs and we didn't want her to have any reactions. We visited several animal shelters in the area and finally found one that fit all of our criteria. He was a little Shih Tzu/Poodle mix that was already housebroken and loved people. He was also very quiet and didn't bark at all, which was something else that we were looking for. We brought him home and named him Oliver. He's been with us for almost two years now, and he's become such an important part of our family! He's so obedient, follows us around the house everywhere we go, and is so quiet that sometimes I forget he's even there! He loves to go on walks, is very well behaved on a leash, and has never once pulled me or run away. He's such a good boy! He also loves to travel with us when we go on vacations! When we stay at hotels, he sleeps in the same room with us on his own little bed that he knows only belongs to him. He is such a good travel companion! When we go on road trips, he rides in his own seat beside me, wearing his special seat belt harness and looking out the window at all of the sights. He has been all over New England with us this way!
