I thought it was going to be easy. I had it all planned out. I was going to make a list, set the timer, and clean my house in 1 hour. I have seen many posts on Pinterest about taking the "1 Hour Challenge". The idea is that you set the timer for 1 hour, and you do as much cleaning as you can in that 1 hour. You can even invite your kids to help! My kids were at school, and my husband was at work, so I figured I could get it done while they were gone. The challenge is to see how much you can get done in that 1 hour. I was determined to get everything done that I needed to get done in that 1 hour. The only problem...I have no idea how people can do it. I mean, I got a lot done, but not everything. I'm not even sure if it's possible to get everything done in 1 hour. First of all, if you want to take the challenge, you need to make a list of what needs to be cleaned. This is essential! If you don't make a list, you might forget something! Here's my list: Vacuum all rooms; mop floors; clean up kitchen; clean up living room; put away laundry; clean bathroom; make beds; pick up toys and put them away; clean up playroom; pick up dog toys and put them away; clean bathroom sink and toilets; sweep porch; clean off coffee table; vacuum couch; put books away; dust all surfaces. That's a lot of stuff! I knew it was going to be a lot of work, but I was determined to get it all done in an hour. Next, you need to set the timer. I used my phone timer because it's more convenient than finding a real timer! Set the timer for 1 hour and start cleaning! Work as quickly as possible until the timer goes off! You can even invite your kids to help you! They will love helping out around the house! My kids weren't home from school yet, so I did it by myself. It's easier when there's no one around though! You don't have to worry about anyone getting in your way or slowing you down!
