Hi, my name is Goku facad, and I'm the project head of the Summarization Nation project. This project is developed as part of the 2022 Incubator. Program at AI camp. Now, I'll have the team walk through our project information. So the mission of Summarization Nation is to be able to summarize audio video files by converting them to text files using audio track transcription capabilities from assembly AI and recursively summarizing them into a variety of outputs using tailored prompts and GBD Three. We created this project out of an interest in making the task of watching videos more efficient, which as students is something we're very familiar with in a post covered, remote intensive world. Our product is mainly targeted towards high school and college students and will act more as a bonus tool and something that will completely replace the task of watching videos. Currently, the project is limited to audio video file types like MP3, MP4, and M A, as well as only the English language input files such as PDFs and text files. Additionally, we are planning to use a new open AI technology, Whisper, to be able to recognize languages other than English. Our AI product utilizes the GPT-3 model as stated previously, which is much more powerful than other APIs and raw NLP models. Undoubtedly, we also do have competition companies. Their respective products are somewhat similar to our project goal, though there are particular areas of our tech stack and the input output features of Summarization Nation in general, that proves an advantage.
